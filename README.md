# Hello World — UI Starter (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a minimal, accessible "Hello World" application that fulfills the UI and design requirements.

## How to Run (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

**Option A — Double-click**  
1. Download and unzip the project.  
2. Double‑click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.  
   - All paths are **relative**; no internet connection required.

**Option B — Local server (recommended)**  
1. Open a terminal in the project folder.  
2. Run a simple static server (pick one):
   - Github Website: https://slaydintorres311-cpu.github.io/hello-world-ui/  
   - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8080` then visit <http://localhost:8080>  

4. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when done.

## What This Demonstrates

- A user interface (form + button) — not a console app.  
- Accessible labels, ARIA live region for announcements.  
- High color contrast and keyboard operability.  
- No unnecessary animations; simple, readable layout.  
- All assets referenced with **relative paths**.

## Files

- `index.html` — Page structure and content.  
- `styles.css` — High-contrast, responsive styles.  
- `script.js` — Behavior: reads name input and prints a greeting.  
- `README.md` — Setup, run instructions, and design notes.
