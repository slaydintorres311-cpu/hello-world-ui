# Hello World — UI Starter (Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a minimal, accessible "Hello World" application that fulfills the UI and design requirements.

## How to Run (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

**Option A — Double-click**  
1. Download and unzip the project.  
2. Double‑click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.  
   - All paths are **relative**; no internet connection required.

**Option B — Local server (recommended)**  
1. Open a terminal in the project folder.  
2. Run a simple static server (pick one):  
   - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8080` then visit <http://localhost:8080>  
   - Node (if installed): `npx serve .`  
3. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when done.

## What This Demonstrates

- A user interface (form + button) — not a console app.  
- Accessible labels, ARIA live region for announcements.  
- High color contrast and keyboard operability.  
- No unnecessary animations; simple, readable layout.  
- All assets referenced with **relative paths**.

## Files

- `index.html` — Page structure and content.  
- `styles.css` — High-contrast, responsive styles.  
- `script.js` — Behavior: reads name input and prints a greeting.  
- `README.md` — Setup, run instructions, and design notes.

## Design Notes

- Contrast ratios exceed WCAG AA for normal text.  
- Focus styles are visible for keyboard users.  
- Form has accessible name/description and live status updates.  

## Submission Guidance (Map to Assignment)

- You can submit this folder as a zipped download (meets “functional website”).  
- Alternatively, host these static files using GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your school web space and submit the URL.  
- Ensure it runs on another computer by keeping the structure intact.

## Customize (Per‑Team Member)

Each team member can:  
- Change the greeting copy or styles (e.g., edit colors in `styles.css`).  
- Add one small UI widget (e.g., a toggle, slider, or dropdown) to show individual work.  
- Update the `<title>` and footer with your name.
